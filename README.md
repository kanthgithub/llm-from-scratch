# What is Pytorch
- Pytorch is tensor-library, Automatic differentiation engine, Deep learning library
- library that allows you to do deep-learning, training and fine-tuning a model

## Tensor-library
- tensor library generalisation of
  1. scalar
  2. matrix
  3. vector
- scalar is a rank-0 tensor that doesn't have a dimension
- vector is a rank-1 tensor that has 1D (1 dimension) or 1 row and multipl columns
- matrix is a rank-2 tensor (2 dimension) or 2 rows and multiple columns

- A tensor library is essentially an array-library
```
torch.tensor ~ numpy.array
```

- PyTorch is a relatively comprehensive library, and one way to approach it is to focus on its three broad components, which are summarized in Figure 1.
